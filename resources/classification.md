**Please note that not understanding and/or not obeying the following instructions can result in your inability to obtain the assessment from this subject.**

# Exam

The exam is separated into two major parts: theoretical and practical. The theoretical part consists of a theory test (20 pts.) and an oral exam (20 pts.). The practical part consists of a programming exam (10 pts.), the defense of your homework (40 pts.), and an optional semestral project (20 pts.).


## Theoretical part

The theoretical part will be testing and evaluating mainly the knowledge that you have learned during the semester lectures. This part will focus on theory without much connection to implementation in any programming language.

### Theory test

Multiple choice tests covering topics from lectures and recommended study materials.

* possible maximum: 20 points
* required minimum: 5 points (25%)


### Oral exam

Oral exams with the lecturer may cover any topic from lectures and recommended study materials. Special focus will be given to topics from Final State Examination (SZZ, Státní závěrečné zkoušky).


* possible maximum: 20 points
* required minimum: 5 points (25%)


## Practical part

The practical part will be testing and evaluating mainly the skills that you have gained during the semester labs. It will be closely dependent on everything that was shown during the labs. Python will be used as the main tool for this part. 

### Programming exam

You will be asked to solve a programming task similar to the homework. This part of the exam will take place in a school computer class.

* possible maximum: 10 points
* required minimum: 2.5 points (25%)


### Assignment defence

The points from homework are collected during the semester but you will have to secure them during the exam. Examinator can ask you to describe any part of your code from any of your assignments. You must be able to prove that you know your solution, how it works and why have you done it in such a way.

* possible maximum: 40 points
* required minimum: 10 points (25%)
* the maximum number of points for late assignment cannot exceed 70 % of normal points
* number of points from a semester is a threshold, you will have to defend them during the exam


### Semestral project (optional)

The semestral project is optional so you don't have to do it. However, if you decide that you want to do some extra work, tell us. You can choose your own topic but it must be accepted by us. For the evaluation of the semestral project, you will have to defend your work in front of the lecturer at the end of the semester. You might be also asked for some more explanations during the exam.

* possible maximum: 20 points
* required minimum: 0 points (0%) 
* project should represent about 40 hours of work of an average student
* you will present your project to the lecturer at the end of the year  


## Points and grades

### Theoretical part

| Subcategory         | Possible MAX | Required MIN |
|---------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Test                | 20           |      5       |
| Oral exam           | 20           |      5       |

### Pracitcal part

| Subcategory         | Possible MAX | Required MIN |
|---------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Programming exam    | 10           |     2.5      |

| Semestral project   | 20           |      0       |


### Final grade
* depends on the sum of all subcategories and fulfillment of the required minimum in each subcategory
    * possible maximum: 110 points in total
    * required minimum: 50 points in total
* if you won't have at least the required minimum in every subcategory you will be classified with F

Grading table:

| Total sum  |  Grade |
|------------|--------|
|     >89    |    A   |
|    89-80   |    B   |
|    79-70   |    C   |
|    69-60   |    D   |
|    59-50   |    E   |
|     <50    |    F   |


## Aditional information
* You should solve the task assigned by the lecturer every week. If you are unable to solve it within one week, notify the lecturer. The lecturer can grant you extra time to finish the task. However, you can get max. 70 % of points. 
* The correct solution to all tasks during the semester can give you up to 80 points (every task can produce an equal fraction of points from this total number).
* Upload your solution via moodle assignments feature.
* Your submission has to be runnable by Python 3.x (Jupyter notebook, .py file)
* If you use different than distribution packages, provide a requirements file for easy installation of the packages via Pip.
* Your code has to result in the expected output without any modification required from the lecturer (debugging, uncommenting).
* Your code needs to be commented and/or self-explanatory (final word has lecturer)
* Submission of solutions in weird formats (pictures, .txt, binary files) or solutions throwing errors will be considered a bad joke and can result in awarding an unlimited negative number of points.
* A lecturer can also award you with an undefined negative number of points if the lecturer finds your solution not original enough, or malignant in any way (final word has lecturer).
* You should be able to explain and defend your solution to prove that you are the author of the solution. Otherwise, the solution may not be accepted and you can be awarded negative points (the final word has lecturer).
