If we combine all that we learned so far we can save values to variables, do some basic math on them, compare the results, and print out what we get. It is nice but it would not be a really good program. To be able to do more advanced stuff we need to have tools to control the flow of the program. That is the reason to learn about **if-else statement**. It allows our program to fork into different ways according to some conditions.\n",

    "The for loop works a bit differently. We can let it run over some iterations. For example over a list of values. We may use two new functions range which makes a series of numbers between given limits and len which tells us the length of a list. If we combine it we can get a series of numbers between 0 and MAX length of a list. That series actually includes all numbers which could be indexed in the current list. Thus we can approach every single item by its index (if you do not know how, see the List section)"
