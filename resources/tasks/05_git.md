# Git and GitHub

This task will be different form the others. It doesn't focus on Python. Instead you have to show some basic knowledge of Git tool.

Task is simple, just follow the steps:

1. get a git tool either by installing it or using the Portable version from moodle 
1. prepare a folder 
1. open a `git bash` console in prepared folder (or use `cd` command to get there in the within the git bash)
1. initialize git repository with command `git init`
1. create few (text) files with some text in them (it may be `.py`, `.txt` or something similar)
1. commit them all to history
1. make few more changes and commit them to history as well
1. you should get at least 8 different commits in your history
    * at least two different `new file` commits (add a new file which was not there before)
    * at least two different `modified` commits (change some text in some files) 
    * (optional) a merge commit of two branches
1. create an empty public repository in GitHub (you need a Github account for that)
1. with commands from github push your local repository to Github remote (if you dont know what SSH is, use HTTPS option)
1. as your solution provide a link to your Github repository in the moodle assignment feature
