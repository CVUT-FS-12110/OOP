# FizzBuzz

Your first task is to implement the simple word game for children which is called FizzBuzz.

## How the game is played:

Players generally sit in a circle. The player designated to go first says the number "1", and the players then count upwards in turn. However, any number divisible by three is replaced by the word fizz and any number divisible by five by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by both three and five (i.e. divisible by 15) become fizz buzz. A player who hesitates or makes a mistake is eliminated.

For example, a typical round of fizz buzz would start as follows:

1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, Fizz Buzz, 31, 32, Fizz, 34, Buzz, Fizz, ...

## The goal:

With all that elimination in case of mistake many children could be feeling bad because of thei failure. You need to help them to avoid such bad feelings. Your task will be to implement the flow of this game so no children in the world have to strugle with this outrageous kind of torturing anymore.


## What is expected:

Your program should print out the numbers and words (one per line) from the example up to the number which will be specified by variable at top of your program. After the printing reaches the specified number it should end and a line "Printing finished" should follow.

To turn in your assignment, send your source code as a script (as file filename.py) and also a screenshot of your screen where both the code and the console with the output of your program are shown.
